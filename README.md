# Binary-Classification
Used ML models to perform binary classification 

## ML models:
1. Naive - Bayes Classifier 
2. Logistic Regression
3. K - Nearest Neighbours 
4. Support Vector Machine 
5. Decision Tree 
6. Random Forest 

Applied Voting Classifier on Naive-bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine and random forest to get the best model.
